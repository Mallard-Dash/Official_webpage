      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Curious and solution-oriented DevOps student with a background in entrepreneurship and logistics. Currently
        studying DevOps Engineering at Chas Academy, with a strong drive to learn new technologies and apply them to
        real-world challenges. My previous experience as a business owner has given me a solid foundation in
        responsibility, structure, and efficiency. I bring a mix of technical curiosity, problem-solving skills, and
        business insight — aiming to grow into a versatile IT professional who can bridge people, processes, and technology.
