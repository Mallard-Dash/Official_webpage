                <p>Hi! My name is Vincent and i'm currently studying at Chas-Academy to become a DevOps-engineer.
                   I was born on the 8th of november 1991, the same year the Sovjet-union dissolved. Cinemas were
                   showing movies like: "Terminator-2", "Silence of the lambs" and "Home alone" and one of my favourite
                   songs were released: "Lily was here by David A. Stewart".             
                    I was raised in TÃ¤by just outside of Stockholm with both my parents and also my two younger
                    brothers. The first time i came in contact with IT was in my early teenage years, when i learned
                    to build my own basic-looking webpage in Dreamweaver through a 2-week course. 
                    After that i didn't build more webpages, but i did and still are building my own stationary computers.

                <div class="box">
                <p>In my mid 20s i did some basic Arduino projects but if we fast forward to late 2024 when i started studying
                    mathematics in order to apply for a university-program in economics. The study-material for the math were
                    in digital form with an extra section about Python-programming. Suddently i started to train myself in Python-programming
                    in the digital math-book. 
                    I didn't pass the math-exam, but i didn't let that drag me down because i've just found a new passion; CODING!
                    After that i started to do my own Python studying, and before i knew it, i've created my first functional program.
                    It was a converter to calculate arrival time based on speed and distance, not complicated stuff. As i'm writing this,
                    I have created several programs in both Python, C and C#. But my strength is not in a specific lanuage. It's 
                    in my ambition and drive. If i'm really into something, i tend to learn twice as fast as normal because I take
                    a "deep-dive" info everything about the perticular subject.
