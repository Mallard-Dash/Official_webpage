      <h2>Hi! I’m Vincent</h2>
      <p>
        I’m currently studying to become a DevOps Engineer at Chas Academy. I was born on
        8 November 1991—the year the Soviet Union dissolved. At the cinema you could catch
        <em>Terminator 2</em>, <em>The Silence of the Lambs</em>, and <em>Home Alone</em>, and one of my favorite tracks,
        “Lily Was Here” by Dave Stewart, was on the radio.
      </p>
      <p>
        I grew up in Täby, just outside Stockholm, with my parents and two younger brothers. My first
        real contact with IT came in my early teens when I took a two-week course in Dreamweaver and
        built a simple website. I didn’t continue with web development back then, but I did (and still do)
        build my own desktop PCs.

      <h2>How I Got Into Coding</h2>
      <p>
        In my mid-twenties I dabbled with Arduino projects, but fast forward to late 2024: while studying
        mathematics to apply for an economics program, I found a bonus section about Python in the digital
        course material. I started experimenting there and got hooked on programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn’t pass the math exam—but I didn’t let that stop me because I had just found a new passion:
        <strong>coding</strong>. I began self-studying Python and soon built my first functional program: a simple travel-time
        calculator based on speed and distance. Since then I’ve created several programs in Python, C, and C#.
        My true strength isn’t one specific language—it’s my <strong>drive and focus</strong>. When I’m into something,
        I deep-dive and learn fast. That mindset now fuels my path into DevOps. I want to be able to master a lot of programming languages!
